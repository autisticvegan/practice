# Tips

Good points about examples:
- Taking responsibility for a shortfall (sensitive information logging).
- Represents information transparently (engaged with the team and also with security, didn't try and hide anything).
- Honored commitments and tracked items to completion.
- Was transparent with the team, although the responded led efforts they were inclusive and asked the team for feedback and ideas.
- No finger-pointing about who caused the issue, the focus was on getting it fixed.
---
- They wanted to build a good relationship with the team, as they were new, so they made an extra effort to produce a better solution.
- They asked several people for feedback.
- They listened to their team lead feedback, recognized their mistake (trying to impress instead of focusing on the solution or maintainability of the code) and accepted it.
- The candidate later demonstrated that feedback and lessons learned stuck with them and applied them on other occasions. 
- Without being asked, they acknowledge another mistake: they overthink things and demonstrated they are actively working to improve them.
---
- Even though they saw the deadline was too tight, they tried to find ways of delivering the project on time with the right quality (focused on simplifying and removing already covered items).
- They communicated and agreed to all simplifications with the project owner. 
- They decided to act as the bridge with the project owner and share the status of the project.
---
- The candidate went beyond their day-to-day work to learn new technologies (front-end, React, NodeJS). Doing it in their free time and even using it to help the other team select the best architecture for the refactor.
- They went out of their comfort zone, learned new things (external technology and front-end architectures in the company) and applied them to practice.
---
- The candidate worked to improve processes in their team and extended it to other teams involved (4 teams).
- The candidate didn't stick to the status quo but pushed back and found a solution to facilitate development and testing in all teams, unblocking everybody and reducing delays.
- The candidate oversaw the implementation from end to end, as they supported other teams to implement the mocks and gathered metrics to see the improvement worked well.

- Why did you choose this story? It was the most recent or relevant. Can you tell another story that demonstrates X.
---
- How did you convince your manager so that you could work on X? Ensure that communication went on smoothly and use data in reporting. Diplomacy and data. Long term vs short term.

- What decisions did you challenge?

Think about:  
- reducing oncall  
- rollbacks / safety  
- feature devs dont need to know infra  
- reduce blast radius
