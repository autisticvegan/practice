- design parking lot - fetch car, park car, structs should be parkinglot, parkingticket, car, space
- tell about a time you were INNOVATIVE (yikes)
- tell about a time you went DEEP (whoaaaaaaa pffffffff)
- alternative impls of path sum problems

### Questions still to answer:
- Why does location and date matter? Or do they? How specific should this be? company name? geography? ????
- "how would you implement this at amazon"? Why would I do that?
- Are you supposed to work on your job more or side projects? Why do people close their laptop at 5pm when there is still stuff to do?
- Do 8 more practice karats (1 each week)
- How to show stories properly when they are attacking the negative space (analogy that you are building fire extinguishers and no one is using them - not because they are bad but because there are no fires, a good thing)
- How to size projects appropriately? (should they be day long projects, 3 month projects, or what? what size are they looking for)

### do
- Take deep dives and tech talks and convert them into stories - remember this process is about psychopathy not about empathy.
