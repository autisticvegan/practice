1. Tell me about a time where you sought out perspectives other than your own to make a product/service/project/assignment better.
2. Tell me about a time when you had to analyze facts quickly, define key issues, and respond immediately to a situation. What was the outcome?
3. Give me an example of a time you used feedback to drive improvement or innovation. What was the situation and what action did you take?
4. Tell me about a goal that you set that took a long time to achieve or that you are still working towards. How do you keep focused on the goal given the other priorities you have?
5. Tell me about a time when you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue. Were you able to find a solution?
6. Give me an example of when you took an unpopular stance in a course/meeting with peers and your instructor/leader and you were the outlier. What was it, why did you feel strongly about it, and what did you do?
7. Tell me about a time you wouldnâ€™t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough. What was the situation?
8. Tell me about a time you made a hard decision to sacrifice short term gain for a longer term goal.
9. Tell me about a time when you realized you needed to have a deeper level of subject matter expertise to complete your assignment or task well.

Tips

Good points about examples:
- Taking responsibility for a shortfall (sensitive information logging).
- Represents information transparently (engaged with the team and also with security, didn't try and hide anything).
- Honored commitments and tracked items to completion.
- Was transparent with the team, although the responded led efforts they were inclusive and asked the team for feedback and ideas.
- No finger-pointing about who caused the issue, the focus was on getting it fixed.

- They wanted to build a good relationship with the team, as they were new, so they made an extra effort to produce a better solution.
- They asked several people for feedback.
- They listened to their team lead feedback, recognized their mistake (trying to impress instead of focusing on the solution or maintainability of the code) and accepted it.
- The candidate later demonstrated that feedback and lessons learned stuck with them and applied them on other occasions. 
- Without being asked, they acknowledge another mistake: they overthink things and demonstrated they are actively working to improve them.

- Even though they saw the deadline was too tight, they tried to find ways of delivering the project on time with the right quality (focused on simplifying and removing already covered items).
- They communicated and agreed to all simplifications with the project owner. 
- They decided to act as the bridge with the project owner and share the status of the project.

- The candidate went beyond their day-to-day work to learn new technologies (front-end, React, NodeJS). Doing it in their free time and even using it to help the other team select the best architecture for the refactor.
- They went out of their comfort zone, learned new things (external technology and front-end architectures in the company) and applied them to practice.

- The candidate worked to improve processes in their team and extended it to other teams involved (4 teams).
- The candidate didn't stick to the status quo but pushed back and found a solution to facilitate development and testing in all teams, unblocking everybody and reducing delays.
- The candidate oversaw the implementation from end to end, as they supported other teams to implement the mocks and gathered metrics to see the improvement worked well.
