1566. Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times


Given an array of positive integers arr, find a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times.

A pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

Return true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return false.


```
 bool containsPattern(vector<int>& arr, int m, int k) {

        int cnt=0;
        for(int i=0;i+m < arr.size(); i++){
            
            if(arr[i]!=arr[i+m]){
              cnt=0;  
            }
            cnt += (arr[i] == arr[i+m]);
            if(cnt == (k-1)*m)
                return true;
            
        }
        return false;
    }
```
