separators are installed, each storage space is one cubic meter (1' x 1' x 1'). Determine the volume of the 
largest space when a series of horizontal and vertical separators are removed.

Algorithm:
Track which separators are removed and remove those nums from a set. Then go through and get the biggest gap for width and height.
Remember go from 1 to n+1.
