- to merge things i.e. google docs or db
- can use operational transformation (OT)
- conflict free replicated data types (CRDT, riak, TomTom GPS, teletype for atom)
- centralized
- consensus vs collaboration (one wins vs keep all)
- apps that automerge allows: Trello / trellis, pixel pusher
- underlying techs for automerge: webRTC, Hypermerge /  DAT Hypercore, Websockets
- convergence guarantee - order might not be the same but the end result is
- if order DOES matter, store it in a conflict buffer
