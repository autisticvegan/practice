## STORY 1: K8s Dash
### Situation:
  
### Task:

### Action:

### Result:

- Quickly delivered within a month of starting
- talk about migration from lyftkube
- 
### Reflection:

- 

### 5 Whys:

- Why not something like Istio, LinkerD, or EKS? - At the time, it was an old version of K8s. It is now being migrated to EKS where tools like this will be less necessary. EKS in the early days lacked certain features around networking that were critical for the biz.

## STORY 2: Adding a link to an internal tool to drive huge user adoption
### Situation:
There are 2 internal tools for this situation at Lyft, one for deploys, and one for infrastructure 

### Task:
Grow DAU, MAU, etc for tool because OKRs measured it. The idea is that the more useful the tool is, the more users would use it, as a total of Lyft's engineering population. There is also the idea of re-using work as much as possible and as wide as possible for maximum possible benefit.

### Action:
Added a link to one tool from another.
I personally owned the box that had links.
The reality is that there was no significant obstacles.

### Result:
- User adoption of infra tool grew by over 20%, which was the single biggest source of traffic as seen by GA
- The tradeoff is about screen space, which is valuable. This is a design challenge which is solved by utilizing space effectively with FE components.
- Thinking about projects in the future, always be aware of a mind-map of how projects connect to each other, and try to link things together. This helps people remember things (method of loci) and also use the given tools more effectively.

### Reflection:
- A lot of people won't read emails or slack messages, which is understandable
- Sometimes small things can have huge impact
