Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them. This is kind of opposite to Bias For Action.
 
## Notes System
### Situation:
- I noticed a common feedback theme for workflows in C was users needing more information or being confused about what things meant. I could have just added a docs link to each page, but I wanted to come up with a better solution.
  
### Task:
- I made a notes system 

### Action:
- experiment with config files
- come up with solution to store notes there
- make system to display notes across workflows
- use the notepanel material ui elements, different levels
- split between open source vs not
- a system where others can contribute too (since other teams own other flows)
- allow for links

### Result:
- people like it, less tickets, positive feedbacks
- default options are great
- instead of a few questions a week, now less
