- design parking lot - fetch car, park car, structs should be parkinglot, parkingticket, car, space
- tell about a time you were INNOVATIVE (yikes)
- tell about a time you went DEEP (whoaaaaaaa pffffffff)
- alternative impls of path sum problems

### Questions still to answer:

- Are you supposed to work on your job more or side projects? Do interviewers want me to close my laptop at 5 pm then go work on side projects, or am I supposed to keep working at my main job and make more progress there? Why do we even need side projects, why can't we demonstrate our passion through our main job instead? I work 60+ hours a week at my main job because I want the products I work on to be successful. But if that's the incorrect methodology to have, I should instead be only working 40 hours and use those 20 extra hours on "side projects". Then that opens a whole new line of questions - which side projects are they looking for? There's infinite possibilites and I need to prioritize it to what is important. I feel like part of this down to the fact that I am on the autism spectrum and don't process emotions the same way other people do, which means that our sense of motivation can also be very different.
   
- How do I talk about stories where I work on "defensive" tools that are related to triage and debugging (analogy that you are building fire extinguishers and no one is using them - not because they are bad but because there are no fires, a good thing) - the less users that use my team's tools the better because that means there's less incidents. However, it seems interviewers are interested in things like user count when they talk about impact. I can't say that I stopped X incidents from happening because I can't see alternative universes where the tools did not exist and incidents did happen.

- How to size projects appropriately? (should they be day long projects, 3 month projects, or what? what size are they looking for)
  
- One thing I struggle with in interviews is the fact that at my job I don't get to choose what I work on, yet I am judged by what I work on (i.e. how many customers did this product impact? What was the technical complexity? What was innovative?). You can work hard and build a good product but it could fail miserably for reasons far beyond your control. It could also be technically simple and not innovative because that's what had to be done, jobs are not about fun or complexity but making your employer richer. It seems like interviewers want you to talk about your successes or impact (how much revenue did it generate?) which is not controllable by low-ranking engineers like myself (the technical decisions get made by the principle and staff engineers). When they ask these questions how do I diplomatically tell them that I cannot control those things? Do I speak in hypothetical terms like "I would've done it like X" even though I don't get to make that decision since I'm not in charge?
