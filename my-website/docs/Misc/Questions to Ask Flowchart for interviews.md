Questions to ask:

- What is the intuition (dp? greedy? math? graph? invert? patterns?) 
- Unique answer or multiple? No answer?
- Is the data sorted? Is it distinct? What are the constraints?
- Halves/Quarters, node count, reverse, sliding window, sum, average, prefix sum?
- Strictly increasing or decreasing? Multiplication vs addition optimizations?
- What time and space complexities are we targeting?
- Any hints?
