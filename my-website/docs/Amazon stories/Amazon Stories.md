# Amazon Stories

# Disclaimer:  
All situations are strictly hypothetical in nature and may or may not have happened in the real universe. Any details may have been changed including but not limited to names, responsibilities, jurisdictions, contributions, technologies, and anything else. These stories are not to be taken necessarily as matter of fact. Project names, company names, any names, may also be sometimes replaced with REDACTED or random letters.

# Things to remember
1. Generally don't talk for more than 90 seconds straight. Pause and let your interviewer ask questions. Ask them directly - "Should I continue?"
2. Control your vocab. "THIS WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE". Reinforce the difficulty and complexity that you faced, don't necessarily gloss over details. Numbers, Numbers, Numbers. 
3. Think about alternatives to what you did (journey of discovery). Could you have merged tools together? Could you build a completely new tool? Could you use an off the shelf solution? Could you use an open-source project? Could you have changed documentation to not have to build something else? Think about how much time you spent to have a minimal solution.

# Example Behavioral Questions:
1. Tell me about a time where you sought out perspectives other than your own to make a product/service/project/assignment better.
2. Tell me about a time when you had to analyze facts quickly, define key issues, and respond immediately to a situation. What was the outcome?
3. Give me an example of a time you used feedback to drive improvement or innovation. What was the situation and what action did you take?
4. Tell me about a goal that you set that took a long time to achieve or that you are still working towards. How do you keep focused on the goal given the other priorities you have?
5. Tell me about a time when you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue. Were you able to find a solution?
6. Give me an example of when you took an unpopular stance in a course/meeting with peers and your instructor/leader and you were the outlier. What was it, why did you feel strongly about it, and what did you do? (conflict)
7. Tell me about a time you wouldnâ€™t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough. What was the situation?
8. Tell me about a time you made a hard decision to sacrifice short term gain for a longer term goal.
9. Tell me about a time when you realized you needed to have a deeper level of subject matter expertise to complete your assignment or task well.

# Mapping:
- 1 -> Customer Obsession, learn and be curious
- 2 -> bias for action, deliver results
- 3 -> customer obsession, delivery results
- 4 -> deliver results, dive deep / bias for action
- 5 -> invent and simplify, customer obsession
- 6 -> Have backbone, ownership
- 7 -> Have Backbone, Insist on the highest standards
- 8 -> insist on the highest standards, dive deep
- 9 -> Learn & B curious, dive deep


Note there is no `Frugality` in the list.

"Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense."

# Questions That Should Be Answered Each Time

- What was the context/background for the situation you were in?
- Where did it occur, when did it happen?
- What was the goal?

Task:
- What was your role?
- What were you trying to achieve?
- Why was it important?
- What were the risks/consequences if nothing happened?

Action:
- What did you personally own?
- How did you do it? How did you influence the outcome?
- Who else was involved?
- What was the most significant obstacle you faced?

Result:
- How did you measure success for this project?
- What results did you achieve? (METRICS OR DIE)
- What trade-offs did you have to make to achieve this?

Followup:
- 5 why's

# Questions Interviewers may ask
Situation and Task:
- Where, when, and why?
- Why is this important? What was the goal?
- What was the initial scope of the project? What were the challenges?
- What were the risks and potential consequences if nothing happened?
- Why did you choose this story to illustrate xyz accomplishments?
- What other stories can you think of that demonstrate xyz?
- Could you come up with an example that is more recent?

Action:
- What did you do, who else was involved?
- Deep prope functional expertise (5 whys)
- Were you the key driver or project owner?
- What was your biggest contribution? What unique value did you bring?
- What was the most significant obstacle you faced?
- Where was the division between what you did versus what the team did?
- How did you set priorities or get manager buy in?
- What decisions did you challenge? Why? How did you influence the right outcome?

Results:
- Things to think about: 
- - cost savings, revenue generation
- - Quantify volume, size, scale
- - Percentage change, YoY improvements
- - Time to market, implementation time, time savings
- - Impact on the customer and team
- - Quality improvements
- Why did you choose to focus on these results? What other results were important?
- You mentioned revenue, what percentage change is that year over year?
- What trade-offs did you have to make to achieve this?
- Tell me more about...the time it took, the customer impact, etc (5 whys)
- What were the lessons learned?
- How would you improve the process or result today?
- How would you implement this at Amazon?
- How did these results compare to your actual goals? (tie it back to goals stated in Situation)


# Tips

Good points about examples:
- Taking responsibility for a shortfall (sensitive information logging).
- Represents information transparently (engaged with the team and also with security, didn't try and hide anything).
- Honored commitments and tracked items to completion.
- Was transparent with the team, although the responded led efforts they were inclusive and asked the team for feedback and ideas.
- No finger-pointing about who caused the issue, the focus was on getting it fixed.

- They wanted to build a good relationship with the team, as they were new, so they made an extra effort to produce a better solution.
- They asked several people for feedback.
- They listened to their team lead feedback, recognized their mistake (trying to impress instead of focusing on the solution or maintainability of the code) and accepted it.
- The candidate later demonstrated that feedback and lessons learned stuck with them and applied them on other occasions. 
- Without being asked, they acknowledge another mistake: they overthink things and demonstrated they are actively working to improve them.

- Even though they saw the deadline was too tight, they tried to find ways of delivering the project on time with the right quality (focused on simplifying and removing already covered items).
- They communicated and agreed to all simplifications with the project owner. 
- They decided to act as the bridge with the project owner and share the status of the project.

- The candidate went beyond their day-to-day work to learn new technologies (front-end, React, NodeJS). Doing it in their free time and even using it to help the other team select the best architecture for the refactor.
- They went out of their comfort zone, learned new things (external technology and front-end architectures in the company) and applied them to practice.

- The candidate worked to improve processes in their team and extended it to other teams involved (4 teams).
- The candidate didn't stick to the status quo but pushed back and found a solution to facilitate development and testing in all teams, unblocking everybody and reducing delays.
- The candidate oversaw the implementation from end to end, as they supported other teams to implement the mocks and gathered metrics to see the improvement worked well.

Think about:  
- reducing oncall  
- rollbacks / safety  
- feature devs dont need to know infra  
- reduce blast radius
