
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by â€œnot invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

## Using libraries for things like Timeline Charting
### Situation:
- 

### Task:
- Did research and figured out that the current offerings didn't really make sense for current project

### Action:
- The use case existed in a space not covered by libraries, a middle ground between graphing/charting on one side and on the other event time lines / historical views. The Y-axis did not really have a use case - it also needed to be able to be merged or customized. Zooming was also useful.
- At first, tried to contribute to upstream, but they were too slow, so forked and went faster
- Encountered some weird state management bugs, but eventually fixed them with persistence
- 

### Result:


### Reflection:
- Forks are important, or at least the activity/speed of an external library
- Charting is hard (look at the graveyard)
-
