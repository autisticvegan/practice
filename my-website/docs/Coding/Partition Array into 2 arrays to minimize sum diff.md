    The best possible partition minimizes the distance to half of the total sum.
    Brute-force collecting sums from the entire input is too expensive.
    Brute-forcing collecting sums from half of the input can be done in (2^15 ~= 32k operations). Cheap!
    The trick is to to split the input into two halves, then match k items from one half with n-k items from the other half.
    Possible sums for one half is sorted to enable binary search.
    If the total sum is not divisible by 2, then 1 needs to be added when calculating the optimal distance from a partition. This is because the search finds the partition closest to half of the total sum, and that side will be 1 closer than the other partition.

Approach:

    Calculate total sum. The goal is to find a partition sum close to half of that sum.
    Split nums into left (nums[:n]) and right (nums[n:]) halves.
    Collect all possible sums for either side. This could be optimized so that only one side is collected, but I opted for a non-optimal solution with less code.
    Sort possible sums in the left side.
    For each sum on the right side that uses k items, match it with a sum on the left side that uses n-k items using binary search. Keep track of the minimum distance to the center point (half of total sum).
    If the total sum is odd, add 1 to the minimum partition distance.

Complexity

    The total number of possible partitions on either side is 2^n.
    The number of possible sums for a given k is the binomial coefficient (n choose k).
    The max number of permutations of size k is given by the largest binomial coefficient, also known as the central binomial coefficient. It's upper-bound approximation is 4^(n/2).
    Sorting is done in O(n * 4^(n/2) * log(4^(n/2))) => O(4^(n/2))
    Searching is done in O(log(4^(n/2))) => O(n/2)
    This gives O(2^n * log(4^(n/2)) + 4^(n/2)) => O(2^n+4^(n/2)) => O(2^n)
