
Leaders have relentlessly high standards â€” many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

## Docs and Actionable Pages (focus on docs)
### Situation:
- there are pages and outdated things (team was swamped)
  
### Task:
- fix them, actively improve the team's oncall and onboarding experience

### Action:
- More unit tests!
- Integration tests! (db script)
- update the docs
- try to decrease blast radius on things
- feature flags
- team docs, team syncs, jira tickets
- continuously talk about things like code review, look for inspiration, and always work through your own docs (onboarding)
- cull or adjust old alarms
  
### Result:
- Decreased SEVs? Hard to tell
- Potentially slowed down (tradeoff)

### Reflection:
- its not about just answering the page - think about how to not have this page in the future, and think about the whole process that led to this point
- always be on the lookout for new processes, there is ductape everywhere, be fearless in improving other holes you see, be curious to find those holes
