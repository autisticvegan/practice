## Notes System
### Situation:
- I noticed a common feedback theme for workflows in C was users needing more information or being confused about what things meant. I could have just added a docs link to each page, but I wanted to come up with a better solution.
  
### Task:
- I made a notes system 

### Action:
- experiment with config files
- come up with solution to store notes there
- make system to display notes across workflows
- use the notepanel material ui elements, different levels
- split between open source vs not
- a system where others can contribute too (since other teams own other flows)
- allow for links

### Result:
- people like it, less tickets, positive feedbacks
- default options are great
