Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

## Spelling Error On Website (weak)
### Situation:
- I noticed a spelling error on a public facing L website for safety. It had been there for years and apparently no one else cared.
  
### Task:
- Fix it.

### Action:
- I started by searching around in github repositories (using sourcegraph and github code search) trying to find the site. This came up fruitless. I next tried searching through the AWS buckets but that was difficult as there was over 50 PB of data and it was hard to find. So eventually after searching around I started contacting people. Most people weren't sure who to contact, but eventually after being persistent I found some people that were in charge of the Contentful system and could update it.

### Result:
- L looks more professional. This spelling error was also highly visible because it was replicated in metadata, which led to it being displayed everytime someone shared a tweet or any kind of social media which utilized the metadata. This wasn't my responsibility at all but I took ownership because that was the right thing to do.

### Reflection:
- Its all about knowing who is in charge of what so things can be quickly fixed.
