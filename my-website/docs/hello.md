# Hello

This site is here to practice for interviews. It has notes about golang, rust, system design (both HLD and LLD, most of it shamelessly stolen from youtubers, books, and tutorials), leetcode sols in go, C++, and sometimes rus, and amazon stories. With all the knowledge on this site, the goal is that anyone can pass L3-L5 interviews. Shoutouts to Algolia for providing the free awesome search and docusaurus for being chill.
