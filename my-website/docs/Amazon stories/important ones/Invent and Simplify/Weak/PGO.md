
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by â€œnot invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time. (this is a weak category)

## PGO system
### Situation:
- people couldn't override gates

### Task:
- fix it, allowing for finer grain control and thus a better xp

### Action:
- BE - new apis, database interactions
- FE - the interface was important, met with designers
- careful about keeping noral funcs working
- can talk about default gates
- platform for future work like tieing gates to other projects alerts
- previously there did exist things like emergency rollouts and certain other check overrides
- idea is to abstract out gates

### Result:
- positive feedback
- there were some edge cases that we fixed
- blast radius reduced

### Reflection:
- be careful of those edge cases
