TODO:

There is a grid of objects, where fireworks are placed. Every day, one firework can be detonated. There is a potential chain reaction whereby the firework will detonate any other fireworks in its cross (i.e. its like the bombs from bomberman) based off its value. Return the minimum number of days to detonate all fireworks.
