# Example Behavioral Questions:
1. Tell me about a time where you sought out perspectives other than your own to make a product/service/project/assignment better.
2. Tell me about a time when you had to analyze facts quickly, define key issues, and respond immediately to a situation. What was the outcome?
3. Give me an example of a time you used feedback to drive improvement or innovation. What was the situation and what action did you take?
4. Tell me about a goal that you set that took a long time to achieve or that you are still working towards. How do you keep focused on the goal given the other priorities you have?
5. Tell me about a time when you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue. Were you able to find a solution?
6. Give me an example of when you took an unpopular stance in a course/meeting with peers and your instructor/leader and you were the outlier. What was it, why did you feel strongly about it, and what did you do? (conflict)
7. Tell me about a time you wouldnâ€™t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough. What was the situation?
8. Tell me about a time you made a hard decision to sacrifice short term gain for a longer term goal.
9. Tell me about a time when you realized you needed to have a deeper level of subject matter expertise to complete your assignment or task well.
